# Titanic Kaggle Dataset

Dataset extracted from Kaggle's Titanic Survivor prediction competition.

## Objective
The dataset is being used for a introductory training into Machine Learning and the scikit library. 

## Notebook
Three different notebooks in Google Colab were created, where the only difference between them resides in the algorithm used for the predictions (all the preprocessing part and other stuff are the same).
